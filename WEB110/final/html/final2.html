				<h3>Familiarize yourself with the CSS layout logic</h3>
				<p>If you don't understand how CSS is laid out you are not
				going to be able to effectively structure your site. The 
				layout model is a grid going from top-to-bottom then left-to-right.
				Certain CSS display rules will alter this model.</p>
				<h3>Keep your styles scalable</h3>
				<table>
					<caption>Useful CSS3 Units</caption>
					<tr>
						<th>Unit</th>
						<th>Description</th>
						<th>Example</th>
						<th>Notes</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>pt</td>
						<td>Measures size in points. Points are 1/72 inches.</td>
						<td class="unit-example"><code>font-size: 18pt;</code></td>
						<td>Great for things intended to be printed</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>px</td>
						<td>Measures size in pixels</td>
						<td class="unit-example"><code>margin: 20px;</code></td>
						<td>Limit use; does not scale down well to mobile</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>em</td>
						<td>Measures size in em spaces. 2em equals double font size.</td>
						<td class="unit-example"><code>font-size: 1.2em;</code></td>
						<td>Great for scalable text.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>%</td>
						<td>Measure sizes as percentage of something else, usually parent element.</td>
						<td class="unit-example"><code>width: 100%;</code></td>
						<td>Great for scaling objects relative to each other, i.e. headings and paragraphs.</td>
					</tr>

				<p>Using <code>px</code> measurements was pretty popular when all of your
				users could be expected to be using a desktop monitor. With	the proliferation
				of mobile devices, this assumption went out the window. Use	<code>em</code> and 
				percentage based measurements which scale better on alternative	screens. <code>px</code>
				measurements can still be effective if you use small amounts (less than 10px is a 
				good rule of thumb).</p>
				<h3>Consider using a CSS reset</h3>
				<p>Every browser has its own default style sheet. While these are typically minimal,
				slight quirks in each one can lead to a malformed site. You can use a CSS reset to 
				level the field.</p>
				<h3>Consider designing for mobile first</h3>
				<p>It's a lot harder to get CSS right for mobile devices. If you design your site for mobile
				first, you have a lot more leeway in scaling it up to larger devices.</p>
				<h3>Utilize Developer Tools</h3>
				<p>Most modern browser come with a set of development tools that will help you design and
				troubleshoot your site. Typically these can be accessed by pressing the <code>F12</code> key.
				They typically support the following features:</p>
					<a href="../img/devtools.png">
						<figure>
								<img src="../img/devtools.png" alt="Microsoft Edge Developer Tools"/>
								<figcaption>Microsoft Edge Developer Tools</figcaption>
						</figure>
					</a>
				<ul>
					<li>Show HTML and CSS syntax errors</li>
					<li>Graphically display CSS box model attributes</li>
					<li>Allow temporary modification of CSS and HTML for testing purposes</li>
					<li>Show full derived CSS properties</li>
					<li>Performance Benchmarking</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This site was designed with the assistance of Microsoft Edge developer tools.</p><br />
				<h3>Utilize CSS minifiers</h3>
				<p>This doesn't really help you develop the CSS, but it is an important step in rolling out
				a website. A minifier will decrease file size allowing for increased bandwidth efficiency.
				Mobile users will love you for this.</p>
				<h3>Horizontal Centering &mdash; The Smart Way</h3>
				<p>To horizontally center elements, use the following:<br />
				<code>selector {margin: 0 auto;}</code><br />
				setting the left and right margins to auto will keep the element horizontally centered
				with respect to its parent element.</p>
				<h3>Use the right DOCTYPE</h3>
				<p>Modern browsers are very smart and can make a lot of guesses about what you actually
				wanted your code to do, but if they have no idea what language you are speaking, they
				can't really make any guesses. The HTML5 DOCTYPE is as follows:<br />
				<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code></p>
				<h3>Avoid using browser specific CSS</h3>
				<p>Frequently in the past, and occasionally still today, it was necessary to use 
				browser-specific CSS rules to create the desired style behavior. However these are
				largely obsolete and make CSS debugging troublesome across different browsers.</p>
				<h3>Validate your CSS</h3>
				<p>We all make mistakes. Unfortunately, browser developers are very forgiving of
				our mistakes and one can end up with an abomination of a site that does not appear
				at all as expected. Utilize the w3c's CSS validator to make sure your CSS is up to
				scratch.</p>
