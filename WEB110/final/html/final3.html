				<h3>Use concise naming</h3>
				<p>Use class and id naming that makes it clear what the rule is 
				likely going to be applied to. <code>#button</code> is not a good 
				identifier as it could be applied to any number of buttons on your
				page. <code>#button-nav-home</code> would be very clear that it is likely
				the home button on your navigation bar.</p>
				<h3>Do not mix style with naming</h3>
				<p>Avoid using style information in the name. The next person who works
				on the website is going to be very confused if he or she sees an id of
				<code>#button-green</code> and there are no green buttons on the site.
				Styles change over time so you shouldn't use style data in names.</p>
				<h3>Pick an organization convention (and stick with it)</h3>
				<p>CSS doesn't really care how you organize your code. For your own sanity however,
				consider implementing a consistent organization strategy. It may be alphabetical, or
				top-to-bottom. Most importantly, <span class="bold">stick with this convention.</span></p>
				<p>Here is an example convention:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Body level selectors</li>
					<li>Header level selectors</li>
					<li>Nav level selectors</li>
					<li>Main level selectors</li>
					<li>Footer level selectors</li>
					<li>Class selectors</li>
					<li>ID selectors</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Keep your code clean</h3>
				<p>During site development you may end up with duplicate selectors and rules. Try to keep these
				cleaned up as you go. It can be very confusing when you have a <code>p</code> selector defined
				in two different places and your site starts doing strange things.</p>
				<h3>Combine selectors with identical rulesets</h3>
				<p>If you have two or more selectors doing the exact same thing, combine the rule. This will save
				space and make your CSS more readable.</p>
				<a href="../img/multiclass.png">
					<figure>
						<img src="../img/multiclass.png" alt="paragraph with two classes"/>
						<figcaption>A paragraph element with <br />two classes assigned.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</a>
				<h3>Use multiple classes</h3>
				<p>Already have two awesome rulesets that both do exactly what you need? Use both of them. You can
				declare as many classes as you like for a tag &mdash; just separate them with a space.
				</p>
				<h3>Utilize shorthand notation</h3>
				<p>Have you ever seen one of these monstrosities?<br />
				<code>p {<br />
				margin-right: 5px;<br />
				margin-left: 6px;<br />
				margin-top: 10px;<br />
				margin-bottom: 10px;<br />
				}</code><br />
				Combine it to save space and improve readability:<br />
				<code>p {margin: 10px 5px 10px 6px;}</code><br /></p>
				<h3>Comment your Code</h3>
				<p>This might be the most underrated tip on this entire site. When you are actively coding CSS
				you know what you are doing. But if you ever have to shelve your project to work on another time,
				or if someone else has to take over your work for you, nobody is going to have any idea what is going
				on. I'm quite fond of a quote:</p>
				<blockquote>Always assume your successor is an axe murderer and knows where you live.</blockquote>
				<h3>Avoid overusing <code>&lt;div&gt;s</code></h3>
				<p>The <code>div</code> element is a very powerful and versatile for creating zones of content to style.
				However if a <code>div</code> is used for everything your style sheet will very quickly become overcluttered.
				Utilize the range of semantic tags added in HTML5.</p>
				<h3>Avoid permanently hiding elements with CSS</h3>
				<p>Some coders try to be clever with things such as <code>h1</code> elements by setting massive negative
				margins or using <code>display: none;</code>. This can cause problems. Your CSS will be cluttered with
				rules that shouldn't really be there, and some search engines penalize sites for having non-rendering
				content.</p>
